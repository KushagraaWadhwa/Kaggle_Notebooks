1. [KaggleX Skill Assessment Challenge](#kagglex-skill-assessment-challenge)
2. [Liver Disease Prediction in India](#liver-disease-prediction-in-india)
3. [Recipe for Rating: Predict Food Rating Using ML](#recipe-for-rating-predict-food-rating-using-ml)

### KaggleX Skill Assessment Challenge

This project involves predicting the price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, fuel type, transmission, and more.

#### Files
- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Test dataset

#### Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load data and inspect for missing values and data types.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using one-hot encoding.
   - Handle missing values using median imputation.
   - Extract numerical values from text (e.g., horsepower from the engine description).
   
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.
   - Train multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

4. **Prediction**:
   - Preprocess the test data and use the best-performing model to make predictions.
   - Prepare the submission file for Kaggle.

### Liver Disease Prediction in India

This project focuses on predicting liver disease presence using a dataset of Indian patient records.

#### Files
- `indian_liver_patient.csv`: Dataset containing patient records.

#### Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load data and inspect for missing values and duplicates.
   - Visualize distributions of various features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using backfill method.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical ones (e.g., Gender).
   - Apply Min-Max scaling to normalize the features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Identify key features indicative of liver disease.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize features using StandardScaler.
   - Train multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Neural Network.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy and classification reports.

5. **SMOTE and Gender-Specific Analysis**:
   - Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
   - Conduct separate analyses for male and female patients.
